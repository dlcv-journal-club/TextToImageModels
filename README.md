# Text To Image Models

**Title**: Introduction to text-to-image models.

**Summary**: Text-to-image models are neural networks that take as input a text prompt and output an image. This groundbreaking technology has ushered in a wave of exciting new applications, spanning image editing, AI-generated art, story boarding, and data augmentation. In this talk, Harvey will delve into the technical details of these models (e.g., Latent diffusion models, ControlNET, ODISE, and DreamBooth), explore their real-world applications, and examine the ethical questions they raise.

**Speaker**: Harvey Mannering is a research software developer at the Advanced Research Computing Centre in UCL having just completed his masters in computer graphics, vision and imaging.  His research interests primarily revolve around AI, in particular computer vision and deep learning.
